# Domain-adaptive-Residual-VAE
A residual VAE trained on MNIST and fine-tuned on EMNIST to handle low-to-moderate domain shift. 

This code is part of a larger project: Cross-Domain Neural Models for Learned Compression ([Repo - domain-adaptive-compression](https://github.com/nav3054/domain-adaptive-compression))
